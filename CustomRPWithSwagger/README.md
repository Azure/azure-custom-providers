Custom providers provide an excellent way to extend azure ARM capabilities. This extension takes the form of a RESTful endpoint and so it is highly recommended that the API be accompanied by a swagger specification.

# How to specify the Swagger during creation of Custom Providers

In the resource deployment section for custom providers, the following section defines the swagger specification: 

```
"Validations" :[
                                {
                                    "ValidationType": "swagger",
                                    "Specification": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raosuhas/managedapps-intro/master/CustomRPWithSwagger/Artifacts/Swagger/pingaction.json"
                                },
                                {
                                    "ValidationType": "swagger",
                                    "Specification": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raosuhas/managedapps-intro/master/CustomRPWithSwagger/Artifacts/Swagger/userresource.json"
                                }
                            ]

```

# Swagger File Path requirements 
The swagger file paths specified should be on a public github repository and the links should point to the raw links for the URI. 


# Swagger validations done by the Custom Providers

There are 2 types of validations done by the resource providers for swagger : 

- ** Deployment Time validation **
During deployment of the cusotm resource provider , validation is done to make sure that the swagger file provided is a valid swagger as per specifications 

- ** Runtime Validations **
When the calls are being made to the custom resource provider , we will make checks against the swagger specifications to make sure that the endpoint is following the specifications for all calls made. Failure to follow the specifications will be flagged as a violation


Swagger specifications make sure that the API's created for custom providers follow the Open API specifications which makes sure that these  : 
- Are usable 
- Follow Best practices
- Make API modelling easier.
